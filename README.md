# probability-and-statistics
As an assignment for my Faculty, second year first semester, I had to work with other two colleagues at a Probability and Statistics Project. This is an app made using the Shiny framework, which provides different plots and tables made by using info from the USArrests DataFrame. It also contains a report, written using RMarkdown.
